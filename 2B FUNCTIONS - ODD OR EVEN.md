## FUNCTIONS - Check Whether a Number is Even or Odd Using a Function

### AIM  
To write a Python program that defines a function to check whether the number 1781 is even or odd.

---

### ALGORITHM

1.Define a function check_even_odd(number).

2.Inside the function, check if the number is divisible by 2 using the modulus operator (%).

3.If the result is 0, print that the number is even.

4.Otherwise, print that the number is odd.
